# Basic-Algorithms

Auther: Rijul Luman. 
I am writing all the basic algorithms like sorting, searching, etc. Using javascript (Node.js) to help fellow coders. 

If you would like to use any part of this projects code in your project, just add the following comment just above the code: 

// This code is borrowed from Rijul Luman : https://github.com/kidpikoon/Basic-Algorithms

My code was writen in node v6.5.0. In rare cases, some of the in-built functions used may not be available in older versions.
